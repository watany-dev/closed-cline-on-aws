# System Patterns and Architecture

## Architectural Overview
Infrastructure management system built on AWS CDK, emphasizing modularity, scalability, and maintainability through infrastructure as code (IaC) principles.

## Core Architectural Patterns
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Modular and Composable Design
- Immutable Infrastructure
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Declarative Configuration Management

## Design Principles
- Separation of Concerns
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Configuration over Convention
- Idempotent Infrastructure Deployment
- Automated Testing and Validation

## Infrastructure Composition Strategy
- Reusable CDK Constructs
- Hierarchical Stack Management
- Environment-Specific Configuration
- Centralized Resource Management
- Cross-Stack References and Dependencies

## Security and Compliance Patterns
- Least Privilege Access
- Automated Security Scanning
- Compliance as Code
- Continuous Security Validation
- Secrets Management

## Deployment and Lifecycle Management
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Blue-Green Deployments
- Rollback and Versioning Mechanisms
- Infrastructure State Management
- Automated Drift Detection

## Scalability and Performance Considerations
- Horizontal Scaling Capabilities
- Resource Optimization
- Performance Monitoring
- Elastic Resource Allocation
- Cost-Efficient Infrastructure Design

## Error Handling and Resilience
- Graceful Degradation
- Retry and Circuit Breaker Patterns
- Comprehensive Logging
- Centralized Error Tracking
- Automated Recovery Mechanisms

## Integration and Extensibility
- Plugin-Based Architecture
- API-Driven Infrastructure Management
- Multi-Cloud Compatibility Considerations
- Third-Party Tool Integration
- Extensible Configuration Management

## Future Evolution Strategies
- Continuous Architecture Refinement
- Emerging Technology Adoption
- Performance and Security Improvements
- Enhanced Observability
- Machine Learning-Driven Optimization
