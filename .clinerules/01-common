## Rules

- Do not perform unauthorized refactoring.
- If file operations fail more than twice, reconsider the plan.
- The following are task completion requirements:
    - All snapshot tests must pass.
    - No errors should occur during `cdk synth`.
    - Perform static analysis using Checkov on the `cdk synth` result and pass all checks.
        - Example command: `checkov -f cdk.out/AppStack.template.json`
        - If certain issues are difficult to resolve, discuss and mark them as ignored.
    - Update ADRs if there are implementation differences.

## Documentation Requirements

- Update relevant documentation in `/docs` when modifying features.
- Keep `README.md` in sync with new capabilities.
- Maintain changelog entries in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Architecture Decision Records
